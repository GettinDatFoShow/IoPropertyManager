- Unit tests for critical functions
- Integration tests for user workflows
- Code review process for all changes

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**: Services and utility functions
2. **Component Testing**: Individual components
3. **Integration Testing**: Feature workflows
4. **E2E Testing**: Complete user journeys
5. **Performance Testing**: Load and responsiveness
6. **Security Testing**: Authentication and authorization

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Development**: Firebase Hosting preview channels
2. **Staging**: Full Firebase environment for testing
3. **Production**: Production Firebase project
4. **Mobile**: Capacitor builds for iOS/Android testing

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Firebase Cost**: Monitor usage and implement cost controls
2. **Performance**: Implement lazy loading and optimization
3. **Offline Support**: Plan for limited connectivity scenarios
4. **Security**: Regular security audits and rule testing

### Project Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to defined MVP features first
2. **Timeline**: Regular progress reviews and adjustment
3. **Quality**: Automated testing and code review process
4. **User Adoption**: Regular user feedback and iteration
