# Phase 2C: Service Item Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
Phase 2C focuses on building comprehensive service request and task management functionality, leveraging our newly organized architecture to create a seamless property maintenance workflow.

## Core Features to Implement

### 1. Service Request Management
- **Service Request Creation**: Property owners can submit maintenance requests
- **Request Categorization**: Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC, Cleaning, Landscaping, etc.
- **Priority Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Emergency
- **Photo Attachments**: Visual documentation of issues
- **Service History**: Complete maintenance timeline per property

### 2. Task Management System
- **Task Assignment**: Assign requests to team members
- **Status Tracking**: Pending → Assigned → In Progress → Completed → Verified
- **Time Tracking**: Log hours spent on each task
- **Resource Management**: Tools, materials, and cost tracking
- **Quality Control**: Approval workflow and customer feedback

### 3. Service Analytics
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, completion rates, customer satisfaction
- **Cost Analysis**: Service costs per property, category, and time period
- **Scheduling Optimization**: Workload distribution and efficiency metrics
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Identify recurring issues and maintenance patterns

## Key Models to Create

### ServiceRequest Interface
```typescript
interface ServiceRequest {
  id: string;
  propertyId: string;
  requesterId: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: ServiceCategory;
  priority: Priority;
  status: ServiceStatus;
  attachments: string[];
  estimatedCost?: number;
  actualCost?: number;
  assignedTo?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  scheduledDate?: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
}
```

### Task Interface
```typescript
interface Task {
  id: string;
  serviceRequestId: string;
  assignedTo: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: TaskStatus;
  timeTracking: TimeEntry[];
  materials: Material[];
  notes: string[];
  completedAt?: Date;
}
```
